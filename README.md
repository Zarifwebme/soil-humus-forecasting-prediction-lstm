# soil-humus-forecasting-prediction-lstm
LSTM-based deep learning model for predicting soil humus percentage using spatial, temporal, and chemical features.


# ðŸŒ± Humus Prediction using LSTM

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the percentage of **humus** in soil based on:
- Location (latitude & longitude),
- Chemical features (P2O5, K2O),
- Time (date-based features),
- Categorical district encoding.

The goal is to assist in agricultural planning and soil analysis using deep learning.
